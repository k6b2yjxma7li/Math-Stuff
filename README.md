# `Math-Stuff`

This repo is an overall merge of my algebra and experimental data management stuff I've created till now.

## Stuff

+ Algebra -- some stuff I've made for checking matrices, vectors, etc.
+ DataStruct -- main module containing useful methods, like: Pearson's R coeff, derivatives and integrals, containers for data
+ Algo -- main file with spectral data estimation algorithm

And so on.
