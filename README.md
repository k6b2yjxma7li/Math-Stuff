# `Math-Stuff`
This repo is an overall merge of my algebra and experimental data management stuff I've created till now.

# Stuff
+ Marching_sphere -- new algorythm by me to polish fitting
+ DataStruct -- main module containing useful methods, like: Pearson's R coeff, derivatives and integrals, containers for data
+ Algo -- main file with spectral data estimation algorithm

And so on.
